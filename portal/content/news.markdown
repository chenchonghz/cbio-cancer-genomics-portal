New plotting features and other improvements:

* Correlation plots that show the relationship between different data types for individual genes.
* Survival analysis - assess survival differences between altered and non-altered patient sets.
* Updated [R Package](cgds_r.jsp) with support for correlation plots and general improvements for retrieving and accessing data in R data frames.
* The [Web Interface](web_api.jsp) now supports basic clinical data, e.g. survival data.
* [Networks](networks.jsp) for pathway analysis are now available for download.

Several new features, including:

* Redesigned and streamlined user interface, based on user feedback and usability testing.
* Advanced support for gene-specific alterations.  For example, users
can now view mutations within TP53, and ignore copy number alterations, or
only view amplifications of EGFR, and ignore deletions.
* Improved performance.
* [Frequently Asked Questions](faq.jsp) document released.
* Updated [Video Tutorial](video.jsp).

* Enhanced [Oncoprints](faq.jsp#what-are-oncoprints), enabling users to quickly visualize genomic alterations across many cases.  Oncoprints now also work in all major browsers, including Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Internet Explorer.
* Official release of our [Web Interface](web_api.jsp), enabling programmatic access to all data.
* Official release of our [R Package](cgds_r.jsp), enabling programmatic access to all data from the R platform for statistical computing.
