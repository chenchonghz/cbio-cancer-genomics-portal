This script requires a platform dependent executable binary called "liftOver". It is available at
http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/. The script also requires a chain file named
"hg18ToHg19.over.chain". Detailed information and required files can be found at
http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver.

Note that the etc directory of this module contains an executable binary for linux platforms and
a chain file. However, it is strongly recommended to check the official liftOver page for
the latest versions of these files.
